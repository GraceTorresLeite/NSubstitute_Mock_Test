# NSubstitute_Mock_Test

Frameworks for creating Mock Objects dispense with implementing code structures that would later be discarded. 

This happens through mechanisms that allow defining the return of methods, properties and even throwing exceptions within classes containing unit tests.

Two free alternatives to mocking on the .NET platform are the **Moq** and **NSubstitute** frameworks.

This project is to demonstrate the creation of Mock Objects in unit tests generated with .NET Core, using the **NSubstitute** framework.
